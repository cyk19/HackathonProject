The problem that our group intends to tackle is that of the over-usage of plastic bags in our society.
After the recent plastic bag ban implemented in New Zealand, our group intends to desiminate scientific facts about how plastic harms the environment so as to disprove the general public who disbelive scientific facts.



We plan to address this through the design of a webpage coded in JS/HTML/CSS with several pages containing information pertaining to the plastic bag ban, their impacts on the environment and their relative impacts as compared to paper bags.
