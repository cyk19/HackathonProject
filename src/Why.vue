        <p class= 'mt-4' align="left">  There are many major impacts of plastic bags on our environment, from economic costs to environmental costs, plastic bag have proven to do massive harm in both sectors.</p>
        <p align="left">
          For the economy, it costs governments massive amounts of money to clear plastic bags from the ocean.  In San Francisco alone, City officials estimate that they spend $8.5 million annually to deal with plastic bag litter. That equates to around 17 cents for every bag distributed in the city.
          Additionally: It costs the state $25 million annually to manage plastic bag pollution.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          With respect to the environment, At least 80 million plastic bags end up as litter on our beaches, streets and parks each year. With them taking up to 1000 years to break down, they can entangle and harm marine life and other animals. In fact, the World Wide Fund for Nature estimates that more than 100,000 whales, seals, turtles, and birds die every year as a result of plastic bags.

            <p class= 'mt-4' align="left">Trash accumulates in 5 ocean garbage patches, the largest one being the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Solving it requires a combination of closing the source and cleaning up what has already accumulated in the ocean.</p>
            <p align="left">
              The natural oceanic forces catches and concentrates the plastic. The larger floating plastic objects will be approached first followed by the smaller pieces. Both the plastic and system are being carried by the current. Wind and waves propel only the system, as the floater sits just above the water surface, while the plastic is primarily just beneath it.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              Waves, winds and currents make the plastic move in a certain manner. The same forces will act on our roaming systems, causing them to gravitate to the areas in the garbage patch with the highest concentration of plastic.The more cleanup systems released, the more plastic will be collected.
            <p align="left">
            Initial work on ocean plastic recycling shows recycled plastic material can be turned into high quality products. Imagine your next phone, chair, car bumper or sunglasses could be made from plastic retrieved from the ocean. Managing plastic litter in a way that makes cleanup self-sustainable is the way moving forward to an environmentally clean Earth.

            <p class= 'mt-4' align="left">Since 1 July 2019, the New Zealand government has banned Single-use plastic shopping bags.</p>
            <p align="left">
              Through the implementation of this law, there will be a reduced amount of plastic bags circulating around. Hopefully resulting in a lower number of plastic bags reaching the ocean.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              Globally more than 40 countries have banned plastic bags. The UN reports that the first to do so was Bangladesh in 2002. South Africa banned plastic bags in 2003, after declaring plastic bags had become so prolific around the country, they were their “national flower”. The government announced hefty fines and even jail terms for their continued use.
            <p align="left">
              People around the world are now becoming more aware of the negative impacts of plastic bags. Let us hope that this will help our future generations.
